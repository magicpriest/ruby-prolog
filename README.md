== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Pure Ruby,
* Tested with Ruby 1.9.3,
* Object-oriented,
* Multiple Prolog environments can be created and manipulated simultaneously,
* Concurrent access to different core instances should be safe,
* Concurrent access to a single core instance might probably explode in odd ways;
