ruby_prolog
    by Preston Lee

	The core engine is largely based on tiny_prolog, though numerous additional enhancements have been made
	such as object-oriented refactorings and integration of ideas from the interwebs. Unfortunately I cannot
	read Japanese and cannot give proper attribution to the original tiny_prolog author. If *you* can, let
	me know and I'll update this document!

== DESCRIPTION:

	An object-oriented pure Ruby implementation of a Prolog-like DSL for easy AI and logical programming.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Pure Ruby.
* Tested with Ruby 1.8.7 (MRI). 
* Object-oriented.
* Multiple Prolog environments can be created and manipulated simultaneously.
* Concurrent access to different core instances should be safe.
* Concurrent access to a single core instance might probably explode in odd ways.

== SYNOPSIS:

  See ruby_prolog_spec.rb for usage examples.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Should work under all popular Ruby interpreters. Please report compatibility problems.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install ruby-prolog

== LICENSE:
